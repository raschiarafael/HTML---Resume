<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
   I am currently studying front-end focused programming, through an online course. I stopped college and decided to find a more suitable learning system for me. 
   My journey might have been terrifying of deciding to take a break from school, because of all the concerns, and opinions of other people.
   But I have finally overcomed such fear, and stood firm about my decision. Even though I had started studying just 4 days ago, this has been more effectively helping me in making progress, 
   and understanding things about programming, that I used to find difficult before.
